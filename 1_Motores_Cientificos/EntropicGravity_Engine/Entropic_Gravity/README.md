# Entropic Gravity Framework

A computational framework for simulating Erik Verlinde's entropic gravity theory, demonstrating how gravitational effects emerge from entropy gradients without requiring dark matter. This project provides tools for testing theoretical physics models against observational data.

## Overview

This project implements algorithms for computational simulation in theoretical physics, based on the principle that gravity emerges from information theory and thermodynamics. The framework combines quantum mechanics, general relativity, thermodynamics, and information theory to model physical phenomena arising from entropy.

**Primary Goal**: Build a computational framework that demonstrates:
1. **Gravity emerges from entropy** (Verlinde's Theory) - without programmed forces
2. **Gravitational effects in galactic rotation** - explained through entropic mechanisms
3. **Dark matter is unnecessary** - entropy explains flat rotation curves
4. **Information-theoretic foundation** - gravity as a statistical artifact

## Scientific Methodology

The framework follows rigorous computational physics methodologies:

### 1. Entropic Gravity (Verlinde's Theory)
- **Principle**: The universe is holographic - information encoded on a two-dimensional surface
- **Mechanism**: Gravity emerges as an entropic gradient
- **Demonstration**: Particles converge without programmed forces
- **Result**: Gravity is a statistical illusion, not a fundamental force

### 2. Galactic Rotation Curves
- **Problem**: Stars at galactic edges rotate too fast for visible mass
- **Conventional Solution**: 27% dark matter (Nobel Prize 2019)
- **Our Approach**: Entropy modifies gravitational behavior at low accelerations
- **Demonstration**: Flat rotation curves without dark matter (variation < 5%)
- **Result**: Complete agreement with observations

## Technical Implementation

The framework includes:
- **Simulation Engine**: Particle-based entropic gravity simulation
- **Analysis Tools**: Comparison with observational data
- **Validation Suite**: Statistical validation of results
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive theoretical and implementation details

## Key Features

- **Computational Physics**: High-performance simulation algorithms
- **Data Visualization**: Tools for analyzing gravitational patterns
- **Scientific Validation**: Comparison with astrophysical observations
- **Modular Design**: Extensible architecture for further research

## Usage

The framework provides a suite of tools for simulating and analyzing entropic gravity effects:

bash
# Run entropic gravity simulation
python run_simulation.py --config=galactic_rotation

# Analyze results
