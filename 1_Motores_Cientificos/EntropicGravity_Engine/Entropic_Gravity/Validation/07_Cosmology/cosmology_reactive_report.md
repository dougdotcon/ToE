# Challenge 7 (Pivot): Reactive Cosmology Report

## The New Hypothesis
We replaced fixed $\Omega_{CDM}$ with a reactive term $\Omega_{app} \propto H(z)$. This implies Dark Matter is an effect of the expansion rate itself.

## Results at z=1.5
- LCDM (Standard): `159.6` km/s/Mpc
- Reactive Entropic: `122.7` km/s/Mpc
- Difference: `36.9` km/s/Mpc

## ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
The model is better than the naive one, but still deviates. Refinement of the alpha coupling constant is needed.
