# Challenge 7: Cosmological Expansion (The Boss Battle)

## Hypothesis Test
We tested the Entropic universe using **only Baryons** ($\Omega_b = 0.049$) against the Standard Model ($\Omega_m = 0.315$).

## Results
- At z=1.5, H_LCDM = `158.7`
- At z=1.5, H_Entropic = `88.1`
- Discrepancy: `70.7` km/s/Mpc

## ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE
The Naive Entropic model **fails** to reproduce the expansion history. Without Dark Matter ($\Omega_m$), there is not enough mass scaling as $(1+z)^3$ to decelerate the universe in the past (or sustain high H(z)). The curve is too flat.

### Scientific Implications
1. **Baryons are not enough:** Even with Entropic gravity, you cannot simply replace $\Omega_m$ with $\Omega_b$ in the Friedmann equation.
2. **Missing Physics:** Verlinde's full theory (2016) suggests an *Apparent* Dark Matter density $\Omega_{D}^{app}$ that emerges from the Entropic Strain.
3. **Next Step:** We must implement the full Emergent Gravity equations where $\Omega_{apparent} \propto \sqrt{H}$ rather than just ignoring it.
