# Challenge 6: Gravitational Lensing (Optical Audit)

## Hypothesis
If Entropic Gravity is real, it must bend light as if 'Dark Matter' were present. The bending angle $\alpha$ should not decay as $1/r$ (Keplerian/Einsteinian) but should stabilize.

## Results
The simulation confirms that the Entropic correction applies to the relativistic potential $\Phi$. The effective mass $M_{eff}$ grows linearly with radius in the deep MOND regime ($g < a_0$), causing the deflection angle to plateau instead of dropping to zero.

## Conclusion
✅ **Lensing Anomaly Resolved.** Entropic Gravity successfully reproduces the 'Dark Matter Lensing Signal' using only Baryonic matter. The theory is consistent with Weak Lensing observations.
