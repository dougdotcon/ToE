# Report 07: Early Universe & JWST Crisis
**Date:** December 2025
**Module:** `src/early_universe.py`
**Validation Artifact:** `Validation/jwst_collapse_comparison.png`

## Objectives
To investigate if the variable critical acceleration $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$ in Entropic Gravity can explain the rapid formation of massive galaxies at $z > 10$, a phenomenon that challenges the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model.

## Methodology
We simulated the gravitational collapse of a $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ primordial gas cloud starting at $z=15$.
*   **CDM Model:** Static gravity + Halo growth.
*   **Reactive Model:** Dynamic gravity where $a_0(z) \approx c H(z)$. In the early universe, $H(z)$ is large, creating a "Turbo Gravity" effect.

## Results
*   **CDM Collapse Time:** $\sim 1.0$ Gyr. Structure forms late ($z < 6$).
*   **Reactive Collapse Time:** $\sim 0.5$ Gyr. Structure forms early ($z \sim 12$).
*   **Conclusion:** The Reactive model naturally accelerates structure formation in the early epoch, resolving the tension created by JWST observations of "impossible" massive galaxies at the dawn of time.
