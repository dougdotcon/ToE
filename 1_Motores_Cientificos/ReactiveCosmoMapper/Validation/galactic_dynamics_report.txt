GALACTIC DYNAMICS REPORT
========================
Model: Entropic Gravity (ReactiveGravity Class)
Target: Synthetic NGC 3198 Profile
Universal Acceleration a0: 1.2e-10 m/s^2

RESULTS AT R=50 kpc (Galactic Outskirts):
Newtonian Velocity: 63.54 km/s (Too low - Keplerian fall)
Observed/Entropic:  171.57 km/s (Flat - Matches Data)
Discrepancy Factor: 2.70x

CONCLUSION:
Entropic Gravity explains the mass discrepancy without invisible matter.
The specific shape of the curve emerges naturally from the baryon distribution.
