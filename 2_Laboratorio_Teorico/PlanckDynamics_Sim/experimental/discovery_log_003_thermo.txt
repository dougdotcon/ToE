# DISCOVERY LOG 003: BLACK HOLE THERMODYNAMICS
TARDIS Gamma: 117.038
Status: Reactive Holes are HOTTER and LESS ENTROPIC.
Interpretation: The 'Reactive Planck Area' dilutes the information density, preventing storage overflow in compressed space.
Consequence: Faster evaporation rate (Gamma^4 factor) unless Area is also renormalized.
